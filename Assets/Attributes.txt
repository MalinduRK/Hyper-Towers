Note:

While some of the assets were created by the developer using software like Adobe Photoshop and FL studio, most were downloaded from external sources such as the following:
-Unity Asset Store
-Pixabay
-Mixkit
-dafont.com
-itch.io
-etc.

Although 90% of the externally obtained assets were properly credited here, the references for some assets used here were lost in space. Please excuse the developer as this is his very first game project and contact him without hesitation for any inquiries.
Also note that this game is not commercial and is created with the intention of a portfolio project.
